                Hi, My name is Georgina Li.<br>
                Welcome to my personal website!<br>
                I'm a 2nd-year GBDA student at the University of Waterloo.<br>
                I'll be showing you a little bit about my background, life, and hobbies here.<br>
            </p>

    <div id="sectionAbout">
        <h2 class="about-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-content1">
          Hello! My name is Georgina Li and I am a second-year student 
          at GBDA in Waterloo. I am also an international student, born in Beijing 
          and raised in Shanghai. I completed my elementary, middle and high school studies in China. 
          In 2022, I came to Canada with my family to start a new journey in my life.
        </p>
       <p class="about-content2">
           I have been passionate about drawing, calligraphy and reading since I was a child. 
         I found that I was able to gain happiness and a sense of satisfaction while doing these things, 
         so I have continued to do so to this day, which has become a big reason why I chose GBDA. 
         GBDA created an opportunity for me to meet and learn from people who come from different places 
         and backgrounds. Besides, in those two years, I've learned a lot that 
         I never learned before, just like writing code. Back when I graduated from high school, 
         I would have NEVER imagined that two years later I would have designed this website by myself!
        </p>
      <p class="about-content3">
           In the future, I hope that as someone who is familiar with both Eastern and Western cultures, 
        I can blend them both in my designs and spread the culture and stories I love to as many people as possible.
